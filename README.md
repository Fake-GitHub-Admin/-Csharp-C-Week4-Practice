**Updated** File: practice3.cs

Alright so I was able to create those empty list, it was very similar to what I had to do with the Java ArrayList however for some reason they do not 
call C# Arraylist vs Array, just an unspoken code. All in all it was a job achieved. I will upload console results as well.

**Side Note:** This was ran on Visual Studio Code, installed .Net components to easily run the C# code.




For 4/21
**Read Me** Make progress on C++, avoid Javascript like challeneges for these two languages, try a more numbering data focus like tic tac toe or maybe battle ship. Giving special focus to the potential products/experience that could be gained from this endeavor.






5/3 - End
